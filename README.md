# VASTHandler

A modern, stand-alone VAST fetcher and parser.

## Status

This project is just getting started, and might not fit your particular
needs. It is meant for VAST Tags to be consumed by a mobile video
platform, and no decisions have been made yet whether or not to support
Flash for example, or to allow / foster "plugins" if you will.
